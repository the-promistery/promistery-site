       Who We Are
      </h2>
      <p>
      	The Promistery is a family owned no-till organic farm located in St. Catharines, Ontario. We started out in 2020 with hopes of bringing healthy produce to our local community free of pesticides and other harmful fertilizers. We currently offer flowers, herbs and vegetables, and are looking to expand in the future.

       Our CSA Program
      </h2>
      <p>
      	CSA, or Community Supported Agriculture, is a program established by market farmers to allow the community to purchase shares at the beginning of the season for that yearâ€™s harvest. The idea to build a relationship between the farm and the community it serves. It benefits the member by getting freshly harvested food, first access to harvested produce, a discount on that produce, and the peace of mind knowing where and how your food is grown. 
 
      </p>
       <p>
      	CSA members will receive local organic vegetables for a guaranteed 20 weeks starting the week of June 14th and lasting until the last week of October. Any additional harvesting weeks before or after the season will be offered at no cost to members - free food! Food will be able to be picked up twice a week (Tuesday and Friday) either from our farm or one of our pick-up locations in town.
